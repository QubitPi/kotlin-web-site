It is a place where the community hangs out along with some members of the JetBrains and Kotlin team (suffix [JetBrains]).</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_68"><p id="-hxb8p7_86">This Slack is not the best place for reporting bugs. For this, please use <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/kt" id="-hxb8p7_87" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTrack</a>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_69"><p id="-hxb8p7_88">Find the right channel to ask your question. There are channels for pretty much every topic.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_70"><p id="-hxb8p7_89">New channels should be focused around a well-known technology or area of interest. Create them sparingly. And before requesting for a new channel, make sure it doesn't exist in any other shape or form. Ask an administrator to create a new channel on the #meta channel. If you do end up creating a channel, make sure you set the topic.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_71"><p id="-hxb8p7_90">Please refrain from cross-posting the same message on multiple channels. It is considered spamming.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_72"><p id="-hxb8p7_91">When you ask a question, please be patient. Don't repeat it. Or at least not immediately.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_73"><p id="-hxb8p7_92">Please do not ping or mention someone directly to get your questions answered, especially project owners, whether the project is Kotlin or other, unless they specifically indicate that you can.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_74"><p id="-hxb8p7_93">Don't split messages into multiple ones. Ask it all in a single message.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_75"><p id="-hxb8p7_94">Use code blocks. Don't paste code as plain text. Slack supports Kotlin markup. If the code you are pasting is longer than a few lines, use &quot;Code or text snippet&quot; available from <code class="code" id="-hxb8p7_95">+</code> menu next to message input. Only first few lines will be displayed to all users and people interested in the code can expand your code to look into details.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_76"><p id="-hxb8p7_96">While it's polite to say &quot;Hi&quot; or &quot;I have a question&quot; before asking something, it doesn't scale and leads to noise. You can say hello in the same message you ask the question if you like.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_77"><p id="-hxb8p7_97">Using threads is not required, but do take into account that it does allow people to more easily follow conversations, especially those jumping in late.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_78"><p id="-hxb8p7_98">Use reactions to show gratitude as opposed to a message. It reduces the noise and gets the message across.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_79"><p id="-hxb8p7_99">Don't use reactions to tell people they're in the wrong place or asking the wrong question. If they're on the wrong channel, point them to the right one. If their question is badly worded, help them correct it. Have empathy.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-hxb8p7_80"><p id="-hxb8p7_100">Take into account cultural differences. As they say, what the British say isn't what the British mean.
